# 64-000-images-from-Car-Connection-Datasetset
 Kaggle has introduced a massive 64,000 images of cars naming this The
Car Connection Picture Dataset by Nicolas Gervais. As mentioned, this dataset was introduced by
Nicolas Garvis. He stated that these pictures are scraped data. He collected originally around 297,000
images. However, many of the interior images were unless. Hence, he had to cut these images down
to around 64,000.
I have decided to go with building a machine model by predicting price using a machine learning
models using factors. Within this approach, they are different stages that need to be completed in
order to get the full analysis on this matter. Therefore, they are five stages that need to be questioned
and they are the following:
 Stage 1 - Examine datasets and identify the key area of potential insight for clients
 Stage 2 - Data Pre-processing
 Stage 3 – Build Model
 Stage 4 – Testing and Validation
 Stage 5 – Visualisation

# Predicting Price using different models for the Kaggle dataset

Use of Python in Juypter

Different aspects used Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and Decision Trees
